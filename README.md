# Project-1-Mental-Health-

Project Introduction-
 
For this project, we examined two different datasets looking at the effects of mental health on undergraduate college university students. We asked specific questions and used Python to answer them and generate visuals. Questions asked:
 
1. 	Does living at home with parents affect a college student's mental health? 
2. 	Does employment status affect a college student's mental health?
3. 	What major causes the most stress? 
4. 	What grade year in college is most stressful on students?
5. 	What gender suffers more from Mental Health?
 
Analysis-
Students living at home with parents have greater specific symptoms associated with mental health disorders. One symptom is an irregular sleep schedule. Another symptom is being either slower than usual or more restless than usual.
Unemployed students reported having significantly greater trouble either falling asleep, staying asleep, or sleeping too much.
All groups of students strongly reported having little energy.
Year 4 is the least stressful year of college.
Engineering , BIT , BSC are the most stressful majors. Visualization shows that 17% of students enrolled in these majors suffered depression, panic attacks and anxiety.
